# Tutorial: Running YOLOv5 Machine Learning Detection on a Raspberry PiÂ 4
YOLOv5 is an extremely powerful and flexible machine learning algorithm that is being used by experts and hobbiests alike. The ability to make this artificial intelligence portable has the potential to impact numerous fields that require low-power, low-impact detection devices, which is why I've developed a tutorial to get YOLOv5 running on a Raspberry Pi 4!

The link below will lead you to the full tutorial, available for anyone from beginners to experts. This repository will be used in that tutorial to download my curated YOLOv5 files and other necessary Python libraries.
